Here, we examined whether protein aggregation occurs in the brain of nondemented, middle-aged humans and whether this is associated with WWOX downregulation. We isolated an N-terminal internal deletion isoform, TPC6AΔ, derived from alternative splicing of the TRAPPC6A (TPC6A) gene transcript. TPC6AΔ proteins are present as aggregates or plaques in the extracellular matrix of the brain such as in the cortex. Filter retardation assays revealed that aggregate formation of TPC6AΔ occurs preceding Aβ generation in the hippocampi of middle-aged postmortem normal humans. In a Wwox gene knockout mouse model, we showed the plaques of pT181-Tau and TPC6AΔ in the cortex and hippocampus in 3-week-old mice, suggesting a role of WWOX in limiting TPC6AΔ aggregation. To support this hypothesis, in vitro analysis revealed that TGF-β1 induces dissociation of the ectopic complex of TPC6AΔ and WWOX in cells, and then TPC6AΔ undergoes Ser35 phosphorylation-dependent polymerization and induces caspase 3 activation and Aβ production. Similarly, knockdown of WWOX by siRNA resulted in dramatic aggregation of TPC6AΔ. Together, when WWOX is downregulated, TPC6AΔ is phosphorylated at Ser35 and becomes aggregated for causing caspase activation that leads to Tau aggregation and Aβ formation.', authors=[Author(name='Jean-Yun Chang'), Author(name='Ming‐Hui Lee'), Author(name='Sing‐Ru Lin')], citationCount=41, referenceCount=42, url=Url('https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/92dc8bc591debf3c2e31d2a8e619845a2ca866bb'), venue='OncoTarget', year=2015, openAccessPdf=Url('https://www.oncotarget.com/article/2876/pdf/'), externalIds=ExternalIds(DOI='10.18632/ONCOTARGET.2876'), citation='temp'),\n",

Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) patients have compromised cilia and signaling. BBS proteins form the BBSome, which binds Rabin8, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activating the Rab8 GTPase, required for ciliary assembly. We now describe serum-regulated upstream vesicular transport events leading to centrosomal Rab8 activation and ciliary membrane formation. Using live microscopy imaging, we show that upon serum withdrawal Rab8 is observed to assemble the ciliary membrane in ∼100 min. Rab8-dependent ciliary assembly is initiated by the relocalization of Rabin8 to Rab11-positive vesicles that are transported to the centrosome. After ciliogenesis, Rab8 ciliary transport is strongly reduced, and this reduction appears to be associated with decreased Rabin8 centrosomal accumulation. Rab11-GTP associates with the Rabin8 COOH-terminal region and is required for Rabin8 preciliary membrane trafficking to the centrosome and for ciliogenesis. Using zebrafish as a model organism, we show that Rabin8 and Rab11 are associated with the BBS pathway. Finally, using tandem affinity purification and mass spectrometry, we determined that the transport protein particle (TRAPP) II complex associates with the Rabin8 NH2-terminal domain and show that TRAPP II subunits colocalize with centrosomal Rabin8 and are required for Rabin8 preciliary targeting and ciliogenesis.', authors=[Author(name='Christopher J Westlake'), Author(name='L.

These functions of Nef involve its ability to remove specific host proteins from the surface of infected cells, including the CD4 receptor. Nef binds to the adaptor protein 2 (AP-2) and CD4 in clathrin-coated pits, forcing CD4 internalization and its subsequent targeting to lysosomes. Herein, we report that this lysosomal targeting requires a variant of AP-1 containing isoform 2 of γ-adaptin (AP1G2, hereafter γ2). Depletion of the γ2 or μ1A (AP1M1) subunits of AP-1, but not of γ1 (AP1G1), precludes Nef-mediated lysosomal degradation of CD4. In γ2-depleted cells, CD4 internalized by Nef accumulates in early endosomes and this alleviates CD4 removal from the cell surface. Depletion of γ2 also hinders EGFR–EGF-complex targeting to lysosomes, an effect that is not observed upon γ1 depletion. Taken together, our data provide evidence that the presence of γ1 or γ2 subunits delineates two distinct variants of AP-1 complexes, with different functions in protein sorting.

How the membrane trafficking system spatially organizes intracellular activities and intercellular signaling networks in plants is not well understood. Transport Protein Particle (TRAPP) complexes play key roles in the selective delivery of membrane vesicles to various subcellular compartments in yeast and animals but remain to be fully characterized in plants. Here, we investigated TRAPP complexes in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) using immunoprecipitation followed by quantitative mass spectrometry analysis of AtTRS33, a conserved core component of all TRAPP complexes. We identified 14 AtTRS33-interacting proteins, including homologs of all 13 TRAPP components in mammals and a protein that has homologs only in multicellular photosynthetic organisms and is thus named TRAPP-Interacting Plant Protein (TRIPP). TRIPP specifically associates with the TRAPPII complex through binary interactions with two TRAPPII-specific subunits. TRIPP colocalized with a subset of TRS33 compartments and trans-Golgi network markers in a TRS33-dependent manner. Loss-of-function tripp mutants exhibited dwarfism, sterility, partial photomorphogenesis in the dark, reduced polarity of the auxin transporter PIN2, incomplete cross wall formation, and altered localization of a TRAPPII-specific component.

       "  Paper(section='temp', query='trafficking protein particle complex 2B', title='Host Cellular Protein TRAPPC6AΔ Interacts with Influenza A Virus M2 Protein and Regulates Viral Propagation by Modulating M2 Trafficking', abstract='ABSTRACT Influenza A virus (IAV) matrix protein 2 (M2) plays multiple roles in the early and late phases of viral infection. Once synthesized, M2 is translocated to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), travels to the Golgi apparatus, and is sorted at the trans-Golgi network (TGN) for transport to the apical plasma membrane, where it functions in virus budding. We hypothesized that M2 trafficking along with its secretory pathway must be finely regulated, and host factors could be involved in this process. However, no studies examining the role of host factors in M2 posttranslational transport have been reported. Here, we used a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) system to screen for host proteins that interact with the M2 protein and identified transport protein particle complex 6A (TRAPPC6A) as a potential binding partner. We found that both TRAPPC6A and its N-terminal internal-deletion isoform, TRAPPC6A delta (TRAPPC6AΔ), interact with M2. Truncation and mutation analyses showed that the highly conserved leucine residue at position 96 of M2 is critical for mediating this interaction. The role of TRAPPC6AΔ in the viral life cycle was investigated by the knockdown of endogenous TRAPPC6AΔ with small interfering RNA (siRNA) and by generating a recombinant virus that was unable to interact with TRAPPC6A/TRAPPC6AΔ. The results indicated that TRAPPC6AΔ, through its interaction with M2, slows M2 trafficking to the apical plasma membrane, favors viral replication in vitro, and positively modulates virus virulence in mice. IMPORTANCE The influenza A virus M2 protein regulates the trafficking of not only other proteins but also itself along the secretory pathway. However, the host factors involved in the regulation of the posttranslational transport of M2 are largely unknown. In this study, we identified TRAPPC6A and its N-terminal internal-deletion isoform, TRAPPC6AΔ, as interacting partners of M2. We found that the leucine (L) residue at position 96 of M2 is critical for mediating this interaction, which leads us to propose that the high level of conservation of 96L is a consequence of M2 adaptation to its interacting host factor TRAPPC6A/TRAPPC6AΔ. Importantly, we discovered that TRAPPC6AΔ can positively regulate viral replication in vitro by modulating M2 trafficking to the plasma membrane.', authors=[Author(name='Pengyang Zhu'), Author(name='Libin Liang'), Author(name='Xinyuan Shao')], citationCount=37, referenceCount=60, url=Url('https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3d6d7ba83b709efd4b411d2ae18f5eaaf5238503'), venue='Journal of Virology', year=2016, openAccessPdf=Url('https://jvi.asm.org/content/jvi/91/1/e01757-16.full.pdf'), externalIds=ExternalIds(DOI='10.1128/JVI.01757-16'), citation='temp'),\n",

The nomenclature of the picornavirus proteins is based on their position in the viral RNA genome but does not necessarily imply a conserved function of proteins of different genera. The enterovirus 2B protein is a small hydrophobic protein that, upon individual expression, is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi complex, reduces ER and Golgi complex Ca2+ levels, most likely by forming transmembrane pores, and inhibits protein trafficking through the Golgi complex. At present, little is known about the function of the other picornavirus 2B proteins. Here we show that rhinovirus 2B, which is phylogenetically closely related to enterovirus 2B, shows a similar subcellular localization and function to those of enterovirus 2B. In contrast, 2B proteins of hepatitis A virus, foot-and-mouth disease virus, and encephalomyocarditis virus, all of which are more distantly related to enteroviruses, show a different localization and have little, if any, effects on Ca2+ homeostasis and intracellular protein trafficking. Our data suggest that the 2B proteins of enterovirus and rhinovirus share the same function in virus replication, while the other picornavirus 2B proteins support the viral life cycle in a different manner. Moreover, we show that an enterovirus 2B protein that is retained in the ER is unable to modify Ca2+ homeostasis and inhibit protein trafficking, demonstrating the importance of Golgi complex localization for its functioning.', authors=[Author(name='A.

Mammalian cells show substantial cpe, most likely a result of the mechanism of virus release, whereas insect cells show little cpe and appear to release virus without cell lysis. Expression analysis of each infected cell type shows one protein, the nonstructural (NS) protein NS3, to be differentially expressed in the different cell types, suggesting it may act in the virus egress pathway.

We map the NS3 region of interaction with p11 to a 13-residue peptide found at the N terminus of the protein and show it effectively competes with p36 (annexin II heavy chain) for p11 ligand binding. Further, we show that the C-terminal domain of NS3 interacts with VP2, the outermost protein of the fully assembled virus particle, suggesting that NS3 forms a bridging molecule that draws assembled virus into contact with the cellular export machinery.

Its deficiency is known to result in the elongation of cilia and causes ciliopathies in humans. However, little is known about how ICK is transported to the ciliary tip. We here show that the C-terminal noncatalytic region of ICK interacts with the intraflagellar transport (IFT)–B complex of the IFT machinery and participates in its transport to the ciliary tip. Furthermore, total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy demonstrated that ICK undergoes bidirectional movement within cilia, similarly to IFT particles. Analysis of ICK knockout cells demonstrated that ICK deficiency severely impairs the retrograde trafficking of IFT particles and ciliary G protein–coupled receptors. In addition, we found that in ICK knockout cells, ciliary proteins are accumulated at the bulged ciliary tip, which appeared to be torn off and released into the environment as an extracellular vesicle. The exogenous expression of various ICK constructs in ICK knockout cells indicated that the IFT-dependent transport of ICK, as well as its kinase activity and phosphorylation at the canonical TDY motif, is essential for ICK function.

We show here that Bet3 has strong self-palmitoylating activity. Incubation of purified Bet3 with [3H]palmitoyl-CoA (Pal-CoA) leads to a rapid and stoichiometric attachment of fatty acids to cysteine-68. Bet3 has an intrinsic affinity for Pal-CoA, and the palmitoylation reaction occurs at physiological pH values and Pal-CoA concentrations. Moreover, Bet3 is also efficiently palmitoylated at cysteine-68 inside vertebrate cells. Palmitoylation can occur late after Bet3 synthesis, but once the fatty acids are bound they are not removed, not even by disassembly of the Golgi complex. Narrowing the hydrophobic tunnel by exchange of alanine-82 with bulkier amino acids inhibits palmitoylation, both in vitro and inside cells, indicating that the fatty acid must insert into the tunnel for stable attachment. Finally, we show that palmitoylation of Bet3 plays a structural role. CD spectroscopy reveals that chemically deacylated Bet3 has a reduced melting temperature.

Analysis of various C-terminally truncated pUL71 proteins fused to enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) identified amino acids 23 to 34 as important determinants for its Golgi complex localization. Sequence analysis and mutational verification revealed the presence of an N-terminal tyrosine-based trafficking motif (YXXΦ) in pUL71. This led us to hypothesize a requirement of the YXXΦ motif for the function of pUL71 in infection. Mutation of both the tyrosine residue and the entire YXXΦ motif resulted in an altered distribution of mutant pUL71 at the plasma membrane and in the cytoplasm during infection. Both YXXΦ mutant viruses exhibited similarly decreased focal growth and reduced virus yields in supernatants. Ultrastructurally, mutant-virus-infected cells exhibited impaired secondary envelopment manifested by accumulations of capsids undergoing an envelopment process. Additionally, clusters of capsid accumulations surrounding the vAC were observed, similar to the ultrastructural phenotype of a UL71-deficient mutant. The importance of endocytosis and thus the YXXΦ motif for targeting pUL71 to the Golgi complex was further demonstrated when clathrin-mediated endocytosis was inhibited either by coexpression of the C-terminal part of cellular AP180 (AP180-C) or by treatment with methyl-β-cyclodextrin. Both conditions resulted in a plasma membrane accumulation of pUL71. Altogether, these data reveal the presence of a functional N-terminal endocytosis motif that is an important determinant for intracellular localization of pUL71 and that is furthermore required for the function of pUL71 during secondary envelopment of HCMV capsids at the vAC. IMPORTANCE Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is the leading cause of birth defects among congenital virus infections and can lead to life-threatening infections in immunocompromised hosts. Current antiviral treatments target viral genome replication and are increasingly overcome by viral mutations. Therefore, identifying new targets for antiviral therapy is important for future development of novel treatment options. A detailed molecular understanding of the complex virus morphogenesis will identify potential viral as well as cellular targets for antiviral intervention. Secondary envelopment is an important viral process through which infectious virus particles are generated and which involves the action of several viral proteins, such as tegument protein pUL71. Targeting of pUL71 to the site of secondary envelopment appears to be crucial for its function during this process and is regulated by utilizing host trafficking mechanisms that are commonly exploited by viral glycoproteins.

The coxsackievirus 2B protein, a small membrane protein that localizes to the Golgi and to a lesser extent to the ER, has been proposed to play an important role in this effect by forming membrane-integral pores, thereby increasing the efflux of Ca2+ from the stores. Here, evidence is presented that supports this idea and that excludes the possibility that 2B reduces the uptake of Ca2+ into the stores. Measurement of intra-organelle-free Ca2+ in permeabilized cells revealed that the ability of 2B to reduce the Ca2+ filling state of the stores was preserved at steady ATP. Biochemical analysis in a cell-free system further showed that 2B had no adverse effect on the activity of the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase, the Ca2+-ATPase that transports Ca2+ from the cytosol into the stores. To investigate whether 2B specifically affects Ca2+ homeostasis or other ion gradients, we measured the lumenal Golgi pH. Expression of 2B resulted in an increased Golgi pH, indicative for the efflux of H+ from the Golgi lumen. Together, these data support a model that 2B increases the efflux of ions from the ER and Golgi by forming membrane-integral pores.

It is one of the leading infectious causes of birth defects and causes severe complications in transplant recipients. By uncovering the unique pathways used by the virus to infect key cells, such as monocytes, responsible for dissemination and persistence, we provide new potential targets for therapeutic intervention. ABSTRACT Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) exhibits a complex host-pathogen interaction with peripheral blood monocytes. We have identified a unique, cell-type specific retrograde-like intracellular trafficking pattern that HCMV utilizes to gain access to the monocyte nucleus and for productive infection. We show that infection of primary human monocytes, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts leads to an increase in the amount of the trafficking protein Syntaxin 6 (Stx6). However, only knockdown (KD) of Stx6 in monocytes inhibited viral trafficking to the trans-Golgi network (TGN), a requisite step for nuclear translocation in monocytes. Conversely, KD of Stx6 in epithelial cells and fibroblasts did not change the kinetics of nuclear translocation and productive infection. Stx6 predominantly functions at the level of the TGN where it facilitates retrograde transport, a trafficking pathway used by only a few cellular proteins and seldom by pathogens. We also newly identify that in monocytes, Stx6 exhibits an irregular vesicular localization rather than being concentrated at the TGN as seen in other cell-types. Lastly, we implicate that viral particles that associate with both Stx6 and EEA1 early in infection are the viral population that successfully traffics to the TGN at later time points and undergo nuclear translocation. Additionally, we show for the first time that HCMV enters the TGN, and that lack of Stx6 prevents viral trafficking to this organelle. We argue that we have identified an essential cell-type specific regulator that controls early steps in efficient productive infection of a cell-type required for viral persistence and disease.

The VTV proteome revealed that a 9-kDa protein, small valosin-containing protein-interacting protein (SVIP), is uniquely present in these specialized vesicles. Our biochemical and morphological data indicate that the VTV contains SVIP. Using confocal microscopy and co-immunoprecipitation assays, we show that SVIP co-localizes with apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB100) and specifically interacts with VLDL apoB100 and coat complex II proteins. Treatment of ER membranes with myristic acid in the presence of cytosol increases SVIP recruitment to the ER in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, we show that myristic acid treatment of hepatocytes increases both VTV budding and VLDL secretion. To determine the role of SVIP in VTV formation, we either blocked the SVIP protein using specific antibodies or silenced SVIP by siRNA in hepatocytes. Our results show that both blocking and silencing of SVIP lead to significant reduction in VTV formation. Additionally, we show that silencing of SVIP reduces VLDL secretion, suggesting a physiological role of SVIP in intracellular VLDL trafficking and secretion.

The disruption of nuclear F-actin after treatment with microfilament inhibitors caused a considerable decrease in vRNPs motility and suppressed the nuclear export of newly produced vRNPs, indicating that the slow, directed movement plays a crucial role in facilitating the nuclear egress of vRNPs.

Trappc1 deficiency in naive T cells increased ferroptosis‐related damage‐associated molecular pattern molecules like high mobility group box 1 or lipid oxidation products like prostaglandin E2, leukotriene B4, leukotriene C4, and leukotriene D4. Functionally, the culture supernatant of Trappc1 cKO naive T cells significantly promoted neutrophils to express inflammatory cytokines like TNFα and IL‐6, which was rescued by lipid peroxidation inhibitor Acetylcysteine. Importantly, Trappc1 cKO mice spontaneously developed severe autoinflammatory disease 4 weeks after birth. Thus, intrinsic expression of Trappc1 in naive T cells plays an integral role in maintaining T‐cell homeostasis to avoid proinflammatory naive T‐cell death‐caused autoinflammatory syndrome in mice.

All three of these proteins inhibited secretion, to various degrees, and directly associated with the Golgi complex, causing trafficking proteins to accumulate in this compartment.

Noncoding exons 2/2b contain the Vif start codon between their alternatively used splice donors 2 and 2b (D2 and D2b). For vif mRNA, intron 1 must be removed while intron 2 must be retained. Thus, splice acceptor 1 (A1) must be activated by U1 snRNP binding to either D2 or D2b, while splicing at D2 or D2b must be prevented. Here, we unravel the complex interactions between previously known and novel components of the splicing regulatory network regulating HIV-1 exon 2/2b inclusion in viral mRNAs. In particular, using RNA pulldown experiments and mass spectrometry analysis, we found members of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoparticle (hnRNP) A/B family binding to a novel splicing regulatory element (SRE), the exonic splicing silencer ESS2b, and the splicing regulatory proteins Tra2/SRSF10 binding to the nearby exonic splicing enhancer ESE2b. Using a minigene reporter, we performed bioinformatics HEXplorer-guided mutational analysis to narrow down SRE motifs affecting splice site selection between D2 and D2b. Eventually, the impacts of these SREs on the viral splicing pattern and protein expression were exhaustively analyzed in viral particle production and replication experiments. Masking of these protein binding sites by use of locked nucleic acids (LNAs) impaired Vif expression and viral replication. IMPORTANCE Based on our results, we propose a model in which a dense network of SREs regulates vif mRNA and protein expression, crucial to maintain viral replication within host cells with varying A3G levels and at different stages of infection.

However, many aspects of this process remain unknown. ABSTRACT Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is a multistep process that implies complex interactions of the viral particles with cellular proteins. The HPV capsid includes the two structural proteins L1 and L2, which play crucial roles in infectious viral entry. L2 is particularly relevant for the intracellular trafficking of the viral DNA toward the nucleus. Here, using proteomic studies we identified CCT proteins as novel interaction partners of HPV-16 L2. The CCT multimeric complex is an essential chaperonin which interacts with a large number of protein targets. We analyzed the binding of different components of the CCT complex to L2. We confirmed the interaction of this structural viral protein with the CCT subunit 3 (CCT3), and we found that this interaction requires the N-terminal region of L2. Defects in HPV-16 pseudoviral particle (PsV) infection were revealed by small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of some CCT subunits. While a substantial drop in the viral infection was associated with the ablation of CCT component 2, even more pronounced effects on infectivity were observed upon depletion of CCT component 3. Using confocal immunofluorescence assays, CCT3 colocalized with HPV PsVs at early times after infection, with L2 being required for this to occur. Further analysis showed the colocalization of several other subunits of CCT with the PsVs. Moreover, we observed a defect in capsid uncoating and a change in PsV intracellular normal processing when ablating CCT3. Taken together, these studies demonstrate the importance of CCT chaperonin during HPV infectious entry. IMPORTANCE Several of the mechanisms that function during the infection of target cells by HPV particles have been previously described. However, many aspects of this process remain unknown. In particular, the role of cellular proteins functioning as molecular chaperones during HPV infections has been only partially investigated. To the best of our knowledge, we describe here for the first time a requirement of the CCT chaperonin for HPV infection. The role of this cellular complex seems to be determined by the binding of its component 3 to the viral structural protein L2. However, CCT’s effect on HPV infection most probably comprises the whole chaperonin complex. Altogether, these studies define an important role for the CCT chaperonin in the processing and intracellular trafficking of HPV particles and in subsequent viral infectious entry.', authors=[Author(name='Marina Bugnon Valdano'), Author(name='P.

However, some proteins are very difficult to be crystallized and their structures are undetermined. Several techniques have been developed to elucidate the structure of macromolecules; X-ray or electron crystallography, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and high-resolution electron microscopy. Among them, electron microscopy based single particle reconstruction (SPA) technique is a computer-aided structure determination method. This method reconstructs the 3D structure from projection images of dispersed protein. A large number of two-dimensional particle images are picked up from EM films, aligned and classified to generate 2D averages, and used to reconstruct the 3D structure by assigning the Euler angle of each 2D average. Due to the necessity of elaborate collaboration between the classical biology and the innovative information technology including parallel computing, scientists needed to break unseen barriers to get a start of this analysis. However, recent progresses in electron microscopes, mathematical algorithms, and computational abilities greatly reduced the height of barriers and expanded targets that are considered to be primarily addressable using single particle analysis. Membrane proteins are one of these targets to which the single particle analysis is successfully applied for the understanding of their 3D structures. For this purpose, we have developed various SPA methods [1-5] and applied them to different proteins [6-8].Here, we introduce reconstructed proteins, and discuss the availability of this technique. The intramembrane-cleaving proteases (I-CLiPs) that sever the transmembrane domains of their substrates have been identified in a range of organisms and play a variety of roles in biological conditions. I-CLiPs have been classified into three groups: serine-, aspartyl- and metalloprotease-type. Signal peptide peptidase (SPP) is an atypical aspartic protease that hydrolyzes peptide bonds within the transmembrane domain of substrates and is implicated in several biological and pathological functions. The structure of human SPP was determined by SPA at a resolution of 22 Å [8]. SPP forms a slender, bullet-shaped homotetramer with dimensions of 85 x 85 x 130 Å. The SPP complex has four concaves on the rhombus-like sides, connected to a large chamber inside the molecule. For the tetrameric assembly, the N-terminal region of SPP was found to be sufficient. Moreover, when N-terminal region was overexpressed, the formation of the endogenous SPP tetramer was inhibited, which suppressed the proteolytic activity within cells. From these data, the N-terminal region is considered to work as the structural scaffold.Transmembrane (TM) translocation of newly synthesized secretion proteins and membrane proteins are carried out by a Sec translocon protein complex. The polypeptide-conducting pore is formed by the SecYEG-SecA complex in bacteria, and the membrane protein SecDF is necessary for the efficient transport of proteins. However the molecular mechanism how SecDF realized efficient transport is not clear. A previous X-ray structural study of the whole protein and subdomain suggest that SecDF has at least two conformational variants, which could reflect molecular dynamics of this protein. To confirm this hypothesis, we analyzed the 3D structure of SecDF using dark field STEM electron tomography and single particle reconstruction. We determined two different whole SecDF protein structures which well explains the X-ray data.

Our results imply that TRAPPIII binds to COPII vesicles at the phagophore assembly site and that COPII vesicles may provide one of the membrane sources used in autophagosome formation. These events are conserved in yeast to mammals.', authors=[Author(name='D.

Our previous work revealed the importance of highly specialized MT regulators that belong to a family called plus-end tracking proteins (+TIPs) in facilitating early stages of infection. These +TIPs perform various functions, such as engaging cargos for transport or engaging peripheral actin to stabilize MTs, suggesting several family members have the potential to contribute to infection in different ways. Here, we reveal that cytoplasmic linker-associated protein 2 (CLASP2), a key regulator of cortical capture and stabilization of MTs, interacts with incoming HIV-1 particles, and we identify a distinct C-terminal domain in CLASP2 that promotes both MT stabilization and early infection. Our findings identify a new +TIP acting as a host cofactor that facilitates early stages of viral infection. ABSTRACT Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) exploits a number of specialized microtubule (MT) plus-end tracking proteins (commonly known as +TIPs) to induce the formation of stable microtubules soon after virus entry and promote early stages of infection. However, given their functional diversity, the nature of the +TIPs involved and how they facilitate HIV-1 infection remains poorly understood. Here, we identify cytoplasmic linker-associated protein 2 (CLASP2), a +TIP that captures cortical MT plus ends to enable filament stabilization, as a host factor that enables HIV-1 to induce MT stabilization and promote early infection in natural target cell types. Using fixed- and live-cell imaging in human microglia cells, we further show that CLASP2 is required for the trafficking of incoming HIV-1 particles carrying wild-type (WT) envelope. Moreover, both WT CLASP2 and a CLASP2 mutant lacking its C-terminal domain, which mediates its interaction with several host effector proteins, bind to intact HIV-1 cores or in vitro-assembled capsid-nucleocapsid (CA-NC) complexes. However, unlike WT CLASP2, the CLASP2 C-terminal mutant is unable to induce MT stabilization or promote early HIV-1 infection. Our findings identify CLASP2 as a new host cofactor that utilizes distinct regulatory domains to bind incoming HIV-1 particles and facilitate trafficking of incoming viral cores through MT stabilization.
